# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

SWAPI REST APIs may take some time to load right away.

### `npm install`

My web application was developed with the use of 'react-bootstrap', 'react-router-dom', and 'react-router-bootstrap'
Node modules have been left out -> a simple 'npm install' will grab all the necessary modules listed under dependencies in the package.json file.
